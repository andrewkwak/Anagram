# Anagram

Created for Applied CS with Google, given a starter code.

Basic application that gives a random word and you have to find anagrams of that word. 
If they are correct, the word will be green, else red.

Needs doing:
Not choosing words that have no anagrams.
A way to determine if you win or not (maybe after 5 successful anagrams?)
Listing out all anagram possibilities after you lose.
